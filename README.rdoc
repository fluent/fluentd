= Fluent

Fluent is an event collector system. It's said that Fluent is generalized version of syslogd, which can deal with JSON object for the log message.

== Archtecture

Fluent collects events from various data sources and write them to files, database or other storages:

    
    Web apps  ---+                 +--> file
                 |                 |
                 +-->           ---+
    /var/log  ------>  fluentd  ------> mail
                 +-->           ---+
                 |                 |
    apache    ----                 +--> fluentd
    

Fluent also supports log transfer:

    
    Web server
    +---------+
    | fluentd -------
    +---------+|     |
     +---------+     |
                     |
    Proxy server     |    Log server, Amazon S3, HDFS, ...
    +---------+      +--> +---------+
    | fluentd ----------> | fluentd ||
    +---------+|     +--> +---------+|
     +---------+     |     +---------+
                     |
    Database server  |
    +---------+      |
    | fluentd ---------> mail
    +---------+|
     +---------+
    

An event consists of *tag*, *time* and *record*. Tag is a string separated with '.' (e.g. myapp.access). It is used to categorize events. Time is a UNIX time when the event occurs. Record is a JSON object.


== Quick Start

  $ gem install fluentd
  $ # install sample configuration file to the directory
