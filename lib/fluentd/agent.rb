  # Agent is the base class of Label, input and output plugins.
  #
  # Agent has:
  #
  #   * A parent Agent, eventually reaches the RootAgent
  #   * Nested Agent instances, whose parent is this Agent
  #
  # Agent can:
  #
  #   * send events to other OutputAgents
  #   * forward events to other OutputAgents (through EventRouter)
  #
  # Agent can't receive events (because Agent is not Collector).
  # EventRouter and OutputAgents are Collector and can receive events.
  #
  # Next step: `fluentd/root_agent.rb`
